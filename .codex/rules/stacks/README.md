# Stack Rules

## Purpose
This folder defines allowed coding stacks and the stack selection rules for new projects.

## What Is Here
- `STACKS.md` as the central stack selection and governance file.
- `vue.md` with the Nuxt-based Vue stack profile and default libraries.

## When To Use
Use this folder when `project_track: coding` is active and a stack decision or stack change is needed.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place feature implementation details or UX/copy content in this folder.

## Maintenance
Add new tools only when explicitly needed, and keep all related path references synchronized.
