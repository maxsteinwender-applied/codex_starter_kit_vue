# General Rules (Codex)

1. One agent per prompt. Never mix responsibilities.
2. For new projects, start with `/start` and complete `.codex/skills/start/PROJECT_START_CHECKLIST.md` first.
3. Read existing files before editing them.
4. Keep decisions explicit and documented in project files.
5. Ask for user confirmation at major handoff points.
6. Keep feature scope testable and bounded.
7. Use stack defaults from `.codex/rules/stacks/STACKS.md` and `.codex/rules/stacks/*.md` unless explicitly overridden.
8. Do not skip QA before deployment.
