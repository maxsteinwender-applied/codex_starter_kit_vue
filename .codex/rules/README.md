# Rules

## Purpose
This folder centralizes quality, security, and execution rules for the active Codex workflow.

## What Is Here
- `general.md`, `frontend.md`, `backend.md`, `security.md`, `policy.md`
- The `stacks/` subfolder with stack-specific constraints.

## When To Use
Use these rules before making architecture, implementation, review, or security-impacting decisions.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place agent role definitions, kickoff checklists, or feature specs in this folder.

## Maintenance
Update rules sparingly and with clear rationale; always check for conflicts with `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
