# Security Rules (Codex)

1. Never commit secrets, tokens, or private keys.
2. Store credentials in environment variables only.
3. Treat all client input as untrusted.
4. Require auth checks before protected operations.
5. Minimize sensitive data in logs and responses.
6. Apply least-privilege defaults for data access.
7. Block deployment when critical security issues are unresolved.
