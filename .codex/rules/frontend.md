# Frontend Rules (Codex)

1. Use stack-selected UI defaults (`PrimeVue`, OSS-only components).
2. Implement loading, empty, error, and success states.
3. Ensure responsive behavior for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
4. Apply semantic HTML and accessibility basics (labels, focus, keyboard paths).
5. Keep components small and composable.
6. Use stack-selected motion and chart libraries by default.
7. Avoid introducing new frontend libraries without `/prod` approval.
8. Start with documented core UI patterns; use advanced primitives only when feature needs justify complexity.
