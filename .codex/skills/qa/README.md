# QA Skills

## Purpose
This folder standardizes QA outputs and release recommendations across the workflow.

## What Is Here
- `qa-report.md` as the template for reproducible test reports and explicit release decisions.

## When To Use
Use this folder for QA handoffs, acceptance checks, and documentation of findings or residual risk.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place implementation instructions or product-prioritization content in this folder.

## Maintenance
Keep the template concise and consistent; add fields only when they are necessary for decisions.
