# Start Gate

## Purpose
This folder contains the mandatory kickoff gate for all new projects.

## What Is Here
- `PROJECT_START_CHECKLIST.md` with required blocks, stop rules, and the summary schema.

## When To Use
Use this folder whenever a new project starts with `/start`, before regular agent work begins.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place implementation details or feature-delivery steps in this folder.

## Maintenance
Update only when there is a clear process decision; required fields and stop rules must remain stable.
