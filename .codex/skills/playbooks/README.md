# Playbooks

## Purpose
This folder documents phase-specific workflows from requirements through deployment.

## What Is Here
- `requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, `frontend.md`, `backend.md`, `qa.md`, `deploy.md`
- Each file describes phase flow, expected inputs/outputs, and quality checks.

## When To Use
Use these playbooks when an agent needs a structured execution path or a clear handoff baseline.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place agent role definitions or final product artifacts in this folder.

## Maintenance
Extend playbooks only with clear, testable process changes and avoid duplicating guidance from other docs.
