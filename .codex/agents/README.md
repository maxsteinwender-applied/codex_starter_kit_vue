# Agents

## Purpose
This folder contains role definitions for slash-tag agents and keeps responsibilities clearly separated.

## What Is Here
- `product.md`, `ux.md`, `copy.md`, `frontend.md`, `qa.md`
- Each file describes responsibilities, boundaries, and handoff expectations for one agent.

## When To Use
Use these files when creating or updating agent behavior, ownership boundaries, or handoff rules.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place stack rules, playbooks, or product documents in this folder.

## Maintenance
Change these files only when role expectations actually change, and keep them consistent with `AGENTS.md`.
